            <title>Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) 1990</title>
            <description>
                Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) consists of a large pile of fortune cookies displayed in a corner of a room. The viewers are invited to take a cookie from the pile. The endless supply aspect of the artwork means that the pile of cookies is continuously replenished, creating an impression that the supply of cookies is never-ending.
